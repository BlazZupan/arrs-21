Direct impact of the project for the economy and society

Biomarker discovery is a slow, laborious, and costly process that involves a multidisciplinary team of statisticians, data scientists, pharmacologists, physicians, and public health regulators. The tools proposed in this project will **radically change the communication between stakeholders**, as they will allow interactive and real-time hypotheses generation and, to an extent, hypotheses evaluation. The participating SME Genialis has a first-hand experience of how difficult it is to explain and justify gene set selection to health authorities – in Genialis' case, the FDA – and diagnostic companies. We see the proposed interactive visual modules as a crucial innovation.

The proposed methods of integrating the public knowledge bases into the automatic interpretation of discovered patterns present a big step towards **data-driven discovery** and are steadily replacing traditional expert-driven discovery. Involving many domain experts used to be crucial at the identification stage of the biomarker discovery process. Data-driven approaches circumvent this bottleneck and democratize access to the hypothesis generation capabilities to many interested parties, from academic labs and university medical centers to biopharma companies.

We propose to develop computational tools to support **much faster rate of scientific discovery**. Very directly, this means reduced costs of development and registration of novel biomarkers, which is an appealing goal for the participating SME. Since the tools will be open-sourced and made available under a permissive license to academia and the industry alike, we envision a wide adoption of the developed methods. The planned dissemination activities, which include YouTube videos and hands-on tutorials, will further empower newcomers into biomarker discovery and provide extra promotion and visibility for Genialis.

Indirect impact of the project for society

Solving the problem of data-driven biomarker discovery may profoundly impact many areas of medicine, and particularly oncology. Cancer has a significant impact on global society. While many efficient and innovative treatments have been developed in recent years, they typically work well on only a fraction of the population. For this reason, new treatments have difficulty finding the right patients in time. The world needs novel biomarkers that accurately capture the patient's physiological state at the treatment decision time. That, at least, is the promise of **precision medicine**, and the tools developed in this project will add an essential milestone on the road to delivering on this promise. What treatment therapies are made available to patients is a function of many variables, most crucially time (cancer is deadly) and money (private and public insurers' policies). Personalized medicine helps save both. 

New biomarkers mean precise and timely delivery of treatment, which in turn means **increased life expectancy and wellbeing of patients in our aging society**. Moreover, **decreased costs of treatment** and waiting lines are expected. The future biomarkers are complex and personalized models of disease, and the tools developed in this project will help create new candidates and present them to relevant stakeholders. It is not a stretch of the imagination to say that it is likely that the democratization of tools for biomarker discovery will give rise to new companies operating in this space. Finally, we are witnessing an emergence of **molecular diagnostic companies** that grow from and around these new biomarkers.
