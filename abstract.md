In the project, we will build a powerful yet intuitive toolbox to support and automate biomarker discovery from survival data. Data science and machine learning methods are drivers of change in sciences and engineering. The computational approaches that can sip through vast data collections, extract exciting patterns, and devise predictive models are becoming omnipresent. In natural sciences, and especially in medicine, algorithms are confronted with an abundance of data sets, availability of diverse data and knowledge sources, and the need to combine them all in a domain user-presentable and explainable way. Current solutions for biomarker discovery for survival analysis – the field we address in this proposal – are primarily available as code fragments in R or Python and require selection and integration with knowledge-bases and data interactive visualization approaches. There is a great need for comprehensive tools that would systematically address biomarker discovery from survival data.

We propose to develop a set of computation methods and interactive and visual data and model exploration techniques to democratize the science of biomarker discovery. The open-source toolbox that we will design will allow domain experts to explore the survival data intuitively. The tool will rank potential biomarkers, visualize their relations in biomarker maps, and use ontologies and other forms of knowledge bases to steer the discovery process and make it interpretable. We will focus on interpreting molecular data and infer biomarkers from gene expression data sets from cancer and drug effects essays. We aim at:

1. Developing a library of computational approaches.
2. Equip them with intuitive graphical interfaces for interactive explorative analysis and embed them within a visual programming framework.
3. Demonstrate their utility in cancer and drug biomarker discovery.

The project is ambitious and challenging, but builds on our previous work. The proposed development of methods will upgrade our published approaches in feature interaction discovery, feature construction, data projection and mapping techniques, and knowledge-based search and interpretation of data visualization. We will borrow the key concepts from all these, like, for example, search techniques for informative visualizations, and specialize them for survival analysis. To support domain users and devise an intuitive toolbox, we will implement the proposed techniques in Orange (http://orangedatamining.com), the data science software of our making. Orange has a huge user base, both in industry and education. Successful engineering practices in developing Orange, one-of-the-largest Python data science toolboxes, will be applied to the proposed project.

In the project, we are teaming-up with Genialis, an SME specializing in data science support for precision medicine with the development team in Slovenia and sales in the US. The project will equip Genialis with the most advanced and intuitive tool for biomarker discovery, providing a cutting-edge solution for a growing number of their customers in this field. Fast-prototyping of biomarker analysis and charming potential customers with informative and interpretable visualizations will provide Genialis with an essential competitive advantage. To us, the proposers from University, the project will offer further support to leadership in combining machine learning and data visualization. Together with Genialis, the project will provide an opportunity to address crucial emergent issues in biomarker discovery and survival data science.
